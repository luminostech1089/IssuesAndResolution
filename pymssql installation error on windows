Issue:
------
While installing pymssql on windows using command 'pip install pymssql', it throws below error:

 _mssql.c
 _mssql.c(314) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'sqlfront.h': No such file or directory
 error: command 'C:\\Users\\abhijit.ghongade\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Common\\Microsoft\\Visual C++ for Python\\9.0\\VC\\Bin\\amd64\\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2
 
Resolution:
-----------
The pip version installed was 7.0.1. So while installing above command it actually fetched .tar.gz file for pymssql module.
But since this module has dependancy on FreeTDS binaries, you need to download and add binaries seperately which is a tedious process.

Upgrade pip version to latest one (> 8.0)
Latest pip downloads and installs pymssql wheel file so you dont need to download FreeTDS binnaries at all.
