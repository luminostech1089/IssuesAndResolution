I want to create a private network on my ESXi host so that i will be able assign IPs in any range i want and IP address
and internet will be available to VMs after deployment.
*********************************************************************************************************************

To do this we need to install pfSense as a VM on ESXi which acts as a router with DHCP enabled.
[pfSense - is an open source firewall/router based on FreeBSD]
There are two interfaces are on pfSense. One interface to connect to external world (WAN) and second interface for internal LAN.
So we just need to provide internet connection to an WAN interface IP address.

Steps:
1) Download and deploy pfSense VM. (Download Link - https://www.pfsense.org/download/)
   Detailed installation stesps are mentioned here - https://calvin.me/part-1-install-pfsense-on-esxi-5-5/
2) Create a network (say "NAT Network" on ESXi). Do not select any physical adapters.
   To create a new network go to -> ESXi -> Configuration TAB -> Networking -> Add Networking
3) Power ON the pfsense VM and check if the two interfaces (networks) are properly mapped.
   VM Network -> WAN
   NAT Network -> LAN
4) Deploy the new VM and select network as "NAT NEtwork".

Thats All!!! Now your new VM will have IP address and internet connectivity.
